# Adaptive Difficulty System

The Aphasia Coach project implements an adaptive difficulty system to personalize therapy prompts for users based on their performance. This system adjusts the difficulty of prompts dynamically using an Elo-like rating mechanism.

## Key Components

- **Difficulty Calculation**: The difficulty of prompts is calculated across multiple dimensions such as frequency, abstractness, length, etc., as defined in [lib/difficultyUtil.ts](mdc:lib/difficultyUtil.ts). This utility provides a comprehensive score for each prompt.

- **User Skill Scores**: Each user's skill level is tracked in Firestore under the `skillScores` field in the user document, with scores for different categories of prompts (e.g., 'genericVocab'). These scores are updated after each user interaction using an Elo-like formula.

- **Prompt Filtering**: During prompt generation and selection, the system filters prompts to match the user's current skill level within a defined difficulty band, as implemented in [app/api/openai/prompts/route.ts](mdc:app/api/openai/prompts/route.ts).

- **Elo Rating Updates**: After each user utterance, the skill score for the relevant category is updated in [app/session/components/VoiceSession.tsx](mdc:app/session/components/VoiceSession.tsx) using the Elo formula. This ensures that successful responses increase the skill score, while unsuccessful ones decrease it, adjusting future prompt difficulty accordingly.

- **Firestore Integration**: The system integrates with Firestore to store and retrieve user skill scores and prompt difficulties, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Workflow

1. **Prompt Generation**: When generating new prompts via OpenAI, the system calculates a target difficulty based on user performance history.
2. **Prompt Selection**: API routes filter available prompts to align with the user's skill level.
3. **User Interaction**: During a voice session, user responses are scored, and feedback is provided.
4. **Skill Update**: Post-interaction, the user's skill score is recalculated using the Elo formula and updated in Firestore.
5. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Subsequent prompts are chosen based on the updated skill score, creating a feedback loop for personalized difficulty adjustment.

This system aims to maintain an optimal challenge level, ensuring users are neither overwhelmed nor under-challenged, thus enhancing the effectiveness of aphasia therapy.
