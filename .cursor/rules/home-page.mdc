# Home Page Structure

The Aphasia Coach home page ([app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx)) serves as the landing page for the application, designed with a professional and modern layout to explain the app's purpose and features.

## Page Components

The home page consists of several key components:

1. **Hero Section** - Introduces the app with a brief description and call-to-action buttons
2. **Features Section** - Displays the four main features of the app with icons and descriptions
3. **Testimonials Section** - Carousel of patient success stories and feedback
4. **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section** - Encourages users to sign in or learn more
5. **Login Section** - Google authentication component for user sign-in

## Authentication Flow

The login component handles Google authentication using Firebase:
- On successful sign-in, the app checks if the user has completed onboarding
- If onboarding is complete, users are redirected to `/session`
- If onboarding is not complete, users are redirected to `/onboarding`

## UI Components

The page uses several UI components from the Shadcn UI library:
- Button
- Badge
- Card
- Carousel
- Avatar

## Custom Components

The page also includes custom components:
- Grid/GridPattern - For decorative background patterns
- GoogleIcon - SVG icon for the sign-in button
