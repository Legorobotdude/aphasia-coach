# Landing Page Design Principles

The Aphasia Coach landing page ([app/page.tsx](mdc:app/page.tsx)) follows specific design principles to ensure a professional, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

## Color Scheme

- **Primary** - Used for CTAs and important elements
- **Background** - Light/dark mode compatible neutral background
- **Accent** - Used for the CTA section background
- **Muted** - Used for secondary text and subtle UI elements

## Typography

- **Headings** - Large, bold text for section headers (text-3xl to text-7xl)
- **Body** - Regular weight text with good line spacing for readability
- **Muted Text** - Lower contrast text for secondary information

## Accessibility Considerations

Aphasia Coach serves users with communication disabilities, so accessibility is paramount:

1. **Text Readability**
   - High contrast text
   - Adequate text size (minimum 16px/1rem)
   - Proper line spacing

2. **Navigation**
   - Clear, descriptive button labels
   - Logical tab order
   - Skip-to-content functionality

3. **Semantic Structure**
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
   - ARIA labels where necessary
   - Keyboard navigable interface

4. **Images and Media**
   - Alt text for all images
   - No auto-playing media that could distract users
   - Non-essential animations can be disabled

## Responsive Design

The landing page is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- Mobile: Default
- Tablet: md (768px)
- Desktop: lg (1024px)

## Continuing Development

When enhancing the landing page:
1. Maintain the established design system
2. Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate focus states
4. Consider the needs of users with aphasia in all design decisions
