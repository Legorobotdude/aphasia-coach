# UI Components

Aphasia Coach uses the [Shadcn UI](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) component library, which is built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. These components are integrated into the `/components/ui` directory.

## Core Components

### General UI
- [Button](mdc:components/ui/button.tsx) - Used for actions, sign-in, and navigation
- [Badge](mdc:components/ui/badge.tsx) - Used for status indicators and labels
- [Card](mdc:components/ui/card.tsx) - Container for content like testimonials and features

### Media and Display
- [Avatar](mdc:components/ui/avatar.tsx) - Used for user and testimonial profiles
- [Carousel](mdc:components/ui/carousel.tsx) - Used for testimonials and image galleries

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Consistency** - Use the provided components rather than creating new ones with similar functionality
2. **Accessibility** - All components are built with accessibility in mind; maintain this standard
3. **Styling** - Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging

## Custom Styling

For custom styling:
- Use the `className` prop to extend components
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- For complex variants, modify the component's source directly

## Icons

The application uses [Lucide React](mdc:https:/lucide.dev) for icons:
- Import icons from `lucide-react`
- Standard size is 16×16 (`w-4 h-4`) or 24×24 (`w-6 h-6`)
- Match icon colors to the rest of the UI using Tailwind classes
